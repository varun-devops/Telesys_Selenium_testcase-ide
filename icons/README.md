# How to Generate Icons

Since we cannot directly create PNG files, you have two options:

## Option 1: Use the Icon Generator HTML (Easiest)

1. Open `icon-generator.html` in your Chrome browser
2. Click the download buttons for each icon size
3. Save the PNG files to the `icons` folder as:
   - `icon16.png`
   - `icon48.png`
   - `icon128.png`

## Option 2: Create Icons Manually

Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.) to create three PNG files:

### Design Specifications:
- **Colors**: Use gradient from #667eea to #764ba2 (purple gradient)
- **Symbol**: A white circle with a small record/play symbol inside
- **Sizes**: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels

### Files Needed:
```
icons/
├── icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)
├── icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)
└── icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
```

## Option 3: Use Online Icon Generators

Visit sites like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://favicon.io/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

Upload a simple design and generate the required sizes.

## Quick Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use any simple PNG images (even colored squares) as placeholders. The extension will still work; it just won't look as polished.
